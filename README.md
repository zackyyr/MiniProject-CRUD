# CRUD Project - Just a Simple Demo

## Purpose:
This is a basic CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) project. The purpose? To practice, and to show how CRUD works in action. Don’t expect anything fancy. It's just a small example to understand the basics of how this stuff is done.

## Feel Free to Use:
You can literally do whatever you want with this. Copy it, edit it, make it your own – it’s all good. This project is here for anyone who wants to learn or play around with CRUD operations.

## Warning:
Look, I’m not gonna lie. I got other projects piling up, and I’m too lazy to finish this one. So yeah, this project isn’t 100% done. But hey, if you're feeling like contributing and adding some features or fixing stuff, go for it. No hard feelings, I’ll appreciate it.
